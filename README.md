Steal a Meal allows users to publicize their meal availability amongst their friends and propose meal dates. It will also have a location-based functionality in which users can see which of their friends are currently within campus's various dining halls. We are also considering a blind (platonic)"date" option, where users can opt in to a shared meal with a friendly stranger.


## Architecture

TODO:  descriptions of code organization and tools and libraries used

We'll be using React Native to build the mobile version of our app. We're currently looking for libraries we find helpful for buttons, calendar setup, and pinging ability. 

We're currently drafting figma pages for basic functionality and user flows.
