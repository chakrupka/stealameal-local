Steal a Meal allows users to publicize their meal availability amongst their friends and propose meal dates. It will also have a location-based functionality in which users can see which of their friends are currently within campus's various dining halls. We are also considering a blind (platonic)"date" option, where users can opt in to a shared meal with a friendly stranger.
