Steal a Meal allows users to publicize their meal availability amongst their friends and propose meal dates. It will also have a location-based functionality in which users can see which of their friends are currently within campus's various dining halls. We are also considering a blind (platonic)"date" option, where users can opt in to a shared meal with a friendly stranger.

## Architecture

We'll be using React Native to build the mobile version of our app. We're currently looking for libraries we find helpful for buttons, calendar setup, and pinging ability.

We're currently drafting figma pages for basic functionality and user flows.

We will be using a micro services architecture to split up servers by functionality.

Mirco services architecture explanation: https://dzone.com/articles/microservice-architecture-learn-build-and-deploy-a

Get started with installation: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/

## Setup

1. Clone repository
2. Set repository as working directory and run `npm install`
3. [Set up Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/)
   - Choose "iOS Simulator" and "Expo Go" and follow instructions
   - Additional useful set up instructions can be found [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment)
4. Start development server with `npx expo start`
   - Press `i` on your keyboard once the server is started to open the iOS simulator

5. **When simulating, go to frontend/.env and replace the IP (everything before the colon) with your actual IP address
